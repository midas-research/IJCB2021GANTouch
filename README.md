This repository contains the code for the paper [Defending Touch-based Continuous Authentication Systems from Active Adversaries Using Generative Adversarial Networks]() authored by [Mohit Agrawal*](https://sites.google.com/view/mohit-agrawal/home), [Pragyan Mehrotra*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pragyan-m/), [Rajesh Kumar](https://sites.google.com/view/kumar7) and [Rajiv Ratn Shah](https://www.iiitd.edu.in/~rajivratn/) (* indicates equal contribution) accepted at [International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB 2021)](http://ijcb2021.iapr-tc4.org/). The code has been tested on Pytorch 1.3.1, Sklearn 0.22.2 and Python 3.6.8.

## Abstract
Previous studies have demonstrated that commonly studied (vanilla) touch-based continuous authentication systems (V-TCAS) are susceptible to population attack. This paper proposes a novel Generative Adversarial Network assisted TCAS (G-TCAS) framework, which showed more resilience to the population attack. G-TCAS framework was tested on a dataset of 117 users who interacted with a smartphone and tablet pair. On average, the increase in the false accept rates (FARs) for V-TCAS was much higher (22%) than G-TCAS (13%) for the smartphone. Likewise, the increase in the FARs for V-TCAS was 25% compared to G-TCAS (6%) for the tablet.
